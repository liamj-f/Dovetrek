# FileStore branch

This is the FileStore branch! Don't delete it pls, definitely don't merge it to main.
If you don't know why this branch is so different to the rest of the branches, it's kind of like Azure Data Factory's adf_publish branch.

Though it should have a ruleset on it that you can't delete it.

Anyway, this branch is for uploading the output files to - such as maps, dataframes etc.
